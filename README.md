# 1JBO-2016

I assume that  1jbo.pdb is the pdb file directly from the rcsb.org.

You then add hydrogen atoms to give 1jboh.pdb.


Things that are not clear to me are as follows:

what is the 1jboic.hin file for? does ic stand for internal connectivity?

you have for example calc470.hin what does the number stand for? chunk number? or iteration number?

what is the contents of makeh2o.out? what is it the output from?
